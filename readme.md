The analyses are comparisons of different life history characteristics between Native (Pomacea paludosa) and Non-native (Pomacea maculata) apple snails including reproduction, survival and growth. The code for model selction for egg clutch laying using hydrologic, seasonal variables, and apple snail densities is housed in the "EggClutch_Analysis" folder.  The code for the analysis between TP and growth and survival is included in the "TPvsGrowth_analysis" folder. The code for summaries of water quality are housed in the "WaterQuality" folder. The data for all analyses are housed in the "data" folder, and a pdf copy of the published manuscript is housed in the "Published MS" folder.
